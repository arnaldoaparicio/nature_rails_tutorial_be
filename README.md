This is a Rails backend API used for the purposes of creating a tutorial implementing Amazon S3 with a Rails front end and a Rails API back end. This is currently a WIP so changes will be constantly made up until the completion of the tutorial. After the completion of this project, updates will be made to add context and/or fix some mistakes.

The tutorial is actively being written in a gist document found [here.](https://gist.github.com/arnaldoaparicio/d4fc59efcbfeda30f1e38b4c544ce7f0) This document is also a work in progress.

If you happen to stumble upon this repository, any feedback is appreciated. Not only will this benefit someone interested in learning but it also helps me learn how to write better documentation.
